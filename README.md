The application allows users to select one or more predefined languages through the interface. Users upload a video file, which is converted into an audio file using the "ffmpeg" package. The audio is then transcribed into text using OpenAI's Whisper model. This transcript is translated into the selected languages using ChatGPT 4-mini, and the translated files are made available for the user to download or view directly in the app. For example, if Turkish, French, and German are chosen, users can view and download the translations in each language. Additionally, users can listen to the translations in the selected languages and download the audio files.
